# Postmortem: Database Connectivity Outage on Payment Processing System

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** 2024-06-11, 14:00 UTC to 2024-06-11, 15:30 UTC

**Impact:** The payment processing system experienced a significant outage, rendering it unable to process transactions. Approximately 75% of users were unable to complete their payments, resulting in failed transactions and a loss of revenue.

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a configuration error in the database connection pool settings, leading to an exhaustion of available connections and subsequent failures in transaction processing.

## Timeline
- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating a sharp increase in failed transaction attempts.
- **14:05 UTC:** Initial investigation by on-call engineer; confirmed widespread transaction failures.
- **14:10 UTC:** Assumption that the issue was related to recent application code changes; code review initiated.
- **14:30 UTC:** Code review did not reveal any issues; focus shifted to database performance.
- **14:45 UTC:** Misleading path: suspected hardware failure in database server; hardware diagnostics initiated.
- **15:00 UTC:** Issue escalated to the Database Administration (DBA) team.
- **15:10 UTC:** DBA team identified high connection count on the database server; reviewed connection pool settings.
- **15:20 UTC:** Discovered misconfigured connection pool settings in the application server.
- **15:30 UTC:** Corrected connection pool settings and restarted the application server; services restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:** The database connection pool was misconfigured to allow a maximum of 50 connections, but the application was designed to handle up to 200 concurrent transactions. This misconfiguration caused the connection pool to be exhausted under high load, leading to transaction failures as new connections could not be established.

**Resolution:** The connection pool settings were corrected to align with the application's concurrency requirements, increasing the maximum number of connections to 250. The application server was restarted to apply the new settings, restoring normal functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of all configuration settings related to critical services, ensuring they are aligned with operational requirements.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement more granular monitoring of connection pool usage and alert thresholds for early detection of similar issues.
3. **Documentation Update:** Update the configuration management documentation to include best practices and standard settings for connection pools.

**TODO:**
1. **Revise Connection Pool Settings:**
   - Verify and adjust connection pool settings across all environments (development, staging, production) to ensure consistency and adequacy.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Add specific monitoring for connection pool metrics, such as active connections and wait times, with alerting mechanisms.
3. **Routine Configuration Audits:**
   - Schedule regular audits of application and database configurations to catch and correct potential misconfigurations.
4. **Team Training:**
   - Provide training sessions for development and operations teams on the importance of proper configuration management and best practices.
5. **Incident Response Update:**
   - Update the incident response plan to include steps for quickly diagnosing and resolving connection pool-related issues.

By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance the robustness of our payment processing system and prevent similar outages in the future.
