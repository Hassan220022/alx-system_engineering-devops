## Background Context

In the realm of Python programming, every object reveals a deep connection to Python’s core philosophy. This project dives into the intricate details of objects in Python, exploring the nuances of object references, mutability, and more, in a theoretical approach meant to deepen your understanding without immediate coding.

---

## Objectives

- Understand why Python is an excellent choice for programming.
- Differentiate between objects, classes, and instances.
- Explain mutable and immutable objects.
- Identify object aliases and their implications.
- Utilize Python's unique method of passing variables to functions.

---

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as editors.
- Scripts will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide version 2.8.\* for coding.
- Ensure all files are executable and terminate with a newline.

### Answer Files

- Answers must be one line in a `.txt` file, no Shebang, and must end with a newline.

---

## Tasks

### Mandatory

- Explore object types and behaviors.
- Experiment with memory addressing and object aliasing.
- Understand and predict output from code snippets involving basic data structures like lists and tuples.

### Advanced

- Develop a function `magic_string` that behaves dynamically with iterative calls.
- Implement a locked class that restricts dynamic creation of new attributes.

## Learning Resources

- Python's official documentation on objects and values.
- Articles on mutable vs. immutable types and list cloning techniques.
