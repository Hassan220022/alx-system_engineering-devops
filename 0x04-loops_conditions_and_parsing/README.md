# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This project explores bash scripting fundamentals including loops, conditions, file operations, and data parsing.

## Learning Objectives
- How to create SSH keys
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- How to use `while`, `until`, and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- Files and other comparison operators and how to use them

## Requirements
- All scripts are written in Bash
- All scripts are exactly executable
- All scripts pass Shellcheck without any errors
- The first line of all scripts is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all scripts is a comment explaining what the script does
